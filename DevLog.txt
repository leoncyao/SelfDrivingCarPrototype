Self Driving Car Prototype:

	Goals are:	
		Make a working self driving car that can:
			avoid obstacles
			be easily customizable
			rotates and moves toward mouse click
		
		Car has:
			One front Raycasts that detects far away objects
			2 whisker Raycasts that detect close objects (more for turning)
							
So far we have created 2 classes:
	Car
	Main

Need better interpolation formula


Need to make a front obstacle deviation formula
	Needs to be proportional to:
		distance from car,
		angle between journeyline and obstacle line
		
Need fields for:
	Forces
	currentAngularAcceleration
	currentVelocity
	currentAcceleration
	currentVelocity
